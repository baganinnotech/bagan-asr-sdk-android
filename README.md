2. Use the Bagan Android SDK to embed the Bagan button to your application or page. For details, see [Bagan AI documentation]( https://Bagan.app/docs/client-api/android/android-api).

## What is Bagan?

Bagan is a conversational AI platform that lets you build voice assistants, chatbots and conversational bots for your business from scratch. It offers the whole set of tools to design, embed and host a voice interface solution for your app:

* [Bagan Studio](https://studio.Bagan.app/) — a web portal where you can create and manage a dialog scenario for the conversational assistant or chatbot
* [Voice SDKs](https://github.com/Bagan-ai) to embed the Bagan voice to applications running on multiple platforms, both web and mobile
* Bagan Cloud — Bagan's AI-backend that hosts and runs voice scripts, and accomplishes all Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks

To enable voice control in your app, Bagan leverages its NLP-powered engine with industry’s best Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech Synthesis tools and methods. There is no need to create datasets or train your voice solution on your own: Bagan automatically trains on voice commands using your app’s terms.
